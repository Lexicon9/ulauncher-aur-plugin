# Arch Package Search for ULauncher
## Description
This extension enables searching for and installing packages for Arch Linux. Typing 'pkg (package name)' will show installation options. Selecting one of the options will copy the command to install it to the clipboard. This is a fork of a probably perfectly fine extension, but the requirement of aurman in the original appears to be arbitrary, and as noted in the aurman README https://github.com/polygamma/aurman#stopped-development-for-public-use yay is suggested over aurman. 
## Requirements
Yay must be installed to enable searching for packages from the AUR. 
## Installation
Open ULauncher, and click the settings cog to open the settings menu. Navigate to the extensions tab, click add extension, and then paste the github link (below) into the field.
